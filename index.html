        <p>These are plugins that I have developed that can be installed on GrayJay.</p>
        <p>To install a plugin, you need to have the GrayJay app installed on your device. You can find it in <a
                href="https://grayjay.app">grayjay.app</a>.</p>
        <p>Once you have GrayJay installed, click the "Open in Grayjay" button below each plugin to install it.</p>
